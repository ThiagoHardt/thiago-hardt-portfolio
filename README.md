# UX

This is a website for a beginner full-stack software developer.
The main goal of the page is to create a web presence and act as a link between the developer and potential employers and or clients.

One of the most important aspects of the website is to keep the navigation simple and as straight-forward as possible. To achieve that I have opted to use a one-page structure, with the main information being the “hero” image followed by the developer’s name and a quick access button linking to the “about” section and another to a downloadable _CV_. Utilizing this structure I make that the most critical information will be not more than 3 clicks away from the user.
